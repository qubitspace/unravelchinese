Dictionary:
----------
Need to add symantecs to words like simplified version of a radical... etc...
	Need to clean up all the radical info and work on relationships
Need to integrate the squished words


Articles:
--------
Article titles can't be unique.
Maybe they should be optional altogether (after tags/categories.)
Block comments if not commentable


Sentences:
----------
Make a view for sentences not dependant on an Article.
	Build out sentence views.
	Create a link from article to view sentences, and get back to the article.
A user can add one translation per sentence
Show the top 3 translations.
Maximum one translation per source or user (source if a source exists, otherwise user required and one translation per user.
New translations should link to user who added it.
Add link from a sentence to the article it belongs to.
Add right panels.

Tags:
----
Add a way to add tags to anything that is (or will be taggable)
	Definitions/Words/Articles/Sentences

Tokens:
------
Have a way to pick or vote the definition that fits best the context.
	Admin or Social:
		depending if it's an admin or social features, or a combination of the two...
		either admin overrides votes or they are side by side.

Words:
------
Add all the links for marking words know/learning/unknown on related words and the main word
Add consistent visuals for if a word is known (including for the word/related_word)

Show all radicals related to a word.
Should make all chars that match a radical as a radical?
	All the words that match a radical should have a foreign key to the radical, which has all the words that use it. (radical_id instead of radical_number)
Related words (sub words, derived words and relations by radical)
	related word should fit in one line and have an expand button
	link to actual word

If one of the definitions is "CL:" then have those in side bar.
If one of the definitions is "see [[" or "see also [[" add to side bar.



Definitions:
	At least one definition that wasn't caught and added in [[]] (see 3C<sānC>)
	Also for "also pr. <pronunciation>" or "also written [["
	Possibly for (lit.)

Comments:
	Be able to vote/flag them out of existence. (Or hide them by default if they are voted down)

UI:
---------
Move header article title, word) inside the content div? and move right bars up? Or add another wrapper around the header


Database:
---------

Sentences:
	Allow sentences that aren't associated with articles. This will work for super beginning content and stuff like idioms.
	Then if you are browsing sentences you can include/exclude articles sentences.


Idioms: select * from words w
	inner join definitions d
	on w.id = d.word_id
	where d.value like '%(idiom)%'

	Have a Idiom token on sentences.
	Make it easy to create Articles/Sentences

Finish processing radical information into dictionary.

Create a word_relationship table with the two words, and the relationship (directional)
	So a radical will have entries in the join table with relationship 'RadicalOf' to all related words
	Conversely a word can have an entry in the table of 'Radical' to it's radicals.
	Can add relationships like 'seeAlso' or similar to...
	Make sure this is actually worth it (I currently think it is...)
		Simplicity of select vs building all the join tables/relationships
		Should I use seperate join tables or fit them all in one?




Misc Content:
Add some static content pages, by either having a basic blog, or some hard coded pages for now...
Describe everything about how the site works and how to use the site.
	Site philosophy
	Site tutorial (what you can do so far)
	Site goals




|-----|
|Admin|
|-----|
Clean up admin pages then add functionality as needed.

Allow creating a translation with a source.
Manage translations on sentence page.
	Reload google/bing translations
	Delete, etc...

Make sure rank is being set correctly on sentences (keep them in a small group to allow re-ordering with a new UI later.)
	Create after_delete hook for sentences to re-order remaining ranks

Content:
---------
Optionally hide the character for unknown characters (always show either only the character or the pinyin)
Get as much content from yoyochinese as I can. (Source it?)

--------------------------
Beta - Improve What's There!
--------------------------
Recipes! Other content

Add option to color words by tone

Categories
	Recipies
	Stories
	Historical

Insert a whole chinese article. It will split it into sentences as best as posisble, but you can edit before submitting.
	Use google or bing translate to show the tranlsation for each sentence.

Instead of 'mark as known' and 'mark as unknown' add a gear icon with all options. Or a Red/yellow/green type button where one is selected.

Public/Private Word Lists and sub lists
	Something that would work for yoyo 300
	Be able to browse all the hsk and most common words, or search, and easily add them to lists (that can be used as flashcards.)
	This will probably be the base for flash cards.

Definition partial with links to tags (and extra tags at the end)
	tags page with all content for that tag

Add a button at bottom to show chinese text and pinyin.

Show articles tags/categories in title
	Allow sharing other stuff as well
Add links to share on social media
Add image to articles
Add image to sources (and a whole page with a review)

Add bookmark to save your spot for longer articles.

GAMES! Challenges, quizes...
	numbers, how fast can you type them in, etc..
	"Type this in: xxx"
		Show the english and the pinyin. And they need to type the chinese.
		This is more realistic practice than writing characters, and still builds memory.

Add ratings to articles

Things can be flaggable for different reasons
Add a way to request content takedowns.

Ajax Comments

Word lists (stats on lists, tests, find material etc.)

Sentence page - People can comment and colaborate on the translations. 

Add a way to add arbitrary tags to a definition? 

Finish Tokenizing (Do some of this not necesarily all for alpha)
	Look ahead to all three words
	Order by how many tokens are associated with that word. (if any).
		It will start out sucking but it will get better over time.

	use tags to help order words (in addition to site usage, which should trump these.)
		Surname (lower priority)
		variant of <word>(as only definition lowers priority)
		see <word> (as only definition lowers priority)
		Tag anything with an upper case (lowers priority, higher priority then surname)
		Lower priority for (archaic) tag

Tokenizing is pretty cool, have something users can tokenize (comments?)
Improve Tokenizing
	Look at possible three words, take word of longest
	Take word from set of three with least deviation
	Take most commonly used word from site
		Take into consideration previous word? For example use a measure word after a number?

Categorization
	Articles should have tags and categories.
	More difficult articles should start having chinese titles (would have to be processed though)
		Article has a title which has a sentence which has tokens that link to words.
	Add a header (english or chinese) to preface the material

Settings (need balance here, can't make it too complicated. Simplicity!)
	Characters size
	Show Pinyin.
	Show Sentence Translations. (easy mode)
	Show top definition for unknown words?
		Maybe show definition if the definition was set and the word in not learning/known
	Character size.
	Text size.
	Settings for where to show translations,
	Auto-show, mouse-over, or hide.
	Simlifited vs Traditional
	Word Spacing/seperators

Word Page:
	For each word, find the words that it is a substring of, and link them.
	Link a word to all its classifiers
	Link a word to it’s components.
	Link <abbr. to> and <abbr. of>/<abbr. for>

Parse Tags
	Parse out “also pr. [pronunciation]” and flag as alternate pronunciation.
	Parse out “also written (simp)|(traditional) [pronunciation] - some value  optional it looks like.
	Remove “lit.” and “fig.” and flag the definition with a type.
	Special parsing for (idiom), these can have a literal meaning plus plus idiom meaning.
	Other tags to parse out potentially:
		(derog.)
		(proverb)
		CL:(simp)|(trad)[pronunciation]
		Taiwan pr.
		surname <name>
		(name)
		(expr.)
		abbr. for 

Replace sth with subject, etc...

Release - Refine (still take it easy on adding new features and move features down to get a release out!)
--------------------------
Conversations
	Invite only
	You can write messages and tokenize them.
	It will look very different for me vs a native chinese speaker.

Allow turning the UI to chinese (need chinese for each option.)
	This could be done over time if you mark one button at a time as known and it shows up in chinese individually.

Easy Mode:
	Allow specifying a specific definition for the easiest content, and show the (here: ) definition under the pinyin for unknown words.
	This is a lot of extra work so it would only be for the easiest content.

Content Discovery
	Discover content based on characters know
	Show progress towards hsk char/word levels
	Recomend new words to learn based on known characters (you should learn a word that is composed of known characters)
	Recomend the next characters that are the most commonly known.
	Be able to view any sentence from an article and save them.

Graphs
	Top known characters by users.
	Site character frequency. (vs global)

Comments should be tokenizable.

Tools
	The site will have some decent tools available. (splitting words, simplified/traditional/pinyin/pronunciation conversions, translations)
	Search by english, simplified, traditional, pinyin
	Build a controller to expose those to the world.

	6000 educated chinese
	1000 characters will make you literate
	200 characters to read menus, basic web pages and newspaper headlines

	While there are well over 50,000 Chinese characters, you don't need to know them all!
	Knowing just 1,000 Chinese characters will enable you to understand approximately 90% of written Chinese.
	Knowing 2,500 characters will enable you to understand approximately 98% of written Chinese.
	And knowing all the 4,000 characters in our database will enable you to understand virtually 100%.
	To be considered literate, you only need to recognize around 3000 characters.

	-----
	Beginner
		can recognize about 500 Chinese characters
		have very limited vocabulary based on those characters
		understand very basic sentence structure
	Elementary

Movies/Audio/Music! with subtitles/transcript/pinyin/translations/definitions
	This will take more work, but there is lots of materials out there to source from
	This will need to have some automation, but can start being more manual
	Example: A music video where the subtitles (taking into consideration the learned words) plays along the bottom.

Tips
	Allow users to associate things with words for tips (images, words, hints)

Pnumonics

Spaced Repetition/Flashcards.

What you need to be able to do to read chinese. Create practice for each
	Map characters to meaning (character recognition)
		Show character, pick or type the meaning
	Group characters into meaningful words (vocabulary)
		User basically tokenizes a text. Easy mode shows options, hard mode doesn't (just click the last char in the next word.
	Group words into meaningful sentences (grammar)
		Some quiz about word order. Drag words into correct order, or pick what one is correct.
	Understand the meaning of sentences in context (pragmatics)
		???

Annotate Comments and Custom Texts
	Premium? This could be useful to read comments that are posted in chinese.
		Might want to keep seperate join tables for this to seperate it from articles.
	Let people upload their own text and use the reader with their known characters.
	These would have to go through some other step before being public (peer reviews or admin acceptance)

Join table from user to word with notes/pictures/mnumonics/etc..

	Memory techniques - Get Emotional

	About
		This site is for beginners to reading (not beginners to chinese). The goal is for people with limited bag of characters to have something to read.
		Hiding pinyin in the mousover makes it too hard to read. (Especially f you have a vocab bigger then your character set.)
		Customizable characters size (recomend you start big and reduce the size as you get to larger texts.)
		All the information is in a single place. Mouseover is reserved for additonal information and word controls)

	Inspiration
		Yoyochinese character course (from beta)
		Chinesereadingpractice.com
		There is some more. not necissarily inspiration though...

	Usage
		Should know some chinese and be familiar with pinyin/characters.
		Not necissarily for learning characters (could be a future features.)
		Find content that you can read, and read stuff.

	Philosophy
		Lots of chinese sites with intermediate to advanced reading material. This site is to get you from beginner to intermediate.

		Most sites have so much content, i'l encourage using as many sites as possible, this site tries to only implement features that it does well.
			Ask people to let me know if i'm not doing something well and i'll re-evaluate the feature.

		I find learning characters a tedious task.
		I want to me able to read in chinese!
		A wall of chinese text is too intimidating, I need something with pinyin.
			What characters do I know vs just recognize? Gets crazy.
			If you marked yourself as knowing 40 characters, then you can focus on reenforcing those characters and slowly learning new ones.

		Need to be able to phase out the pinyin.
		Learning characters is usefull, but i prefer to learn chinese words!
		Diversify! Use this along with other methods. (any way to integrate with other methods?) (download card packs?)
		Write too! Will this be implemented into the site?
		Speak first then read, and also write for practice...
		Use spacial/visual memories (memory palace.) Crazy, raunchy, stinky, wierd, excentric the better.
		You don't have to try to read every character. just skim/read the english translations and focus on the your characters you are learning. (requires easy mode.)
