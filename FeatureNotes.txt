Collect radical information from BDBG
	https://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?cdqrad=1 TO
	https://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?cdqrad=214
	Creating mapping table from Radical to words that have it as a radical (add to word page.)

	OR
	
	http://www.chinese-tools.com/tools/sinograms.html?r
	http://www.chinese-tools.com/tools/sinograms.html?r=女

Add search by radical? Or is that implied by having a radical link to all words?
Should make all chars that match a radical as a radical?
	All the words that match a radical should have a foreign key to the radical, which has all the words that use it. (radical_id instead of radical_number)

All the places I have a word (even in the tooltips) use a partial, that includes a tooltip. (simplified version)
	First get a list of all the pages, then build the partials...

Dictionary should have a better view per result.
	Some indication if known/unknown/learning

Finish Definitions Tooltip
	The icon should highlight when it's open and unhighlight when it closes
	Need a link to the sentence translations page.

	
Change from JS to CSS for changing the bottom learnable text color (add/remove a class)
Change from JS to css for showing/hiding translations.

Finish Word show page
	related words (sub words, derived words and relations by radical)
		related word should fit in one line and have an expand button
		link to actual word

Finish sentence show page (mostly done right?)
	A user can add one translation per sentence
	Show the top 3 translations.
	Maximum one translation per source or user (source if a source exists, otherwise user required and one translation per user.
	New translations should link to user who added it.
	Add link from a sentence to the article it belongs to.

Add some static content pages, by either having a basic blog, or some hard coded pages for now...

Add a right bar to every page that has disclaimer about alpha! (links would require a blog, might move to beta)
	Site is in alpha
	Link to site philosophy
	Link to site tutorial (what you can do so far)
	Link to site goals (with basic timelines)

Allow creating articles with a source

Make articles publishable

Make commenting disableable per article

	Allow creating a translation with a source.

Create admin pages (tags, sources, articles, sentences, words, tokens, ...)
	Keep basic (don't fret about functionality OR style)
	Add delete translation button (for individual translations)
		Add a retranslate button if it doesn't have a google/bing translation
		Only translate for sources that don't already exist

Make sure rank is being set correctly on sentences (keep them in a small group to allow re-ordering with a new UI later.)
	Create after_delete hook for sentences to re-order remaining ranks

--------------------------
Beta - Improve What's There!
--------------------------

Categories
	Recipies
	Stories
	Historical

Insert a whole chinese article. It will split it into sentences as best as posisble, but you can edit before submitting.
	Use google or bing translate to show the tranlsation for each sentence.

Instead of 'mark as known' and 'mark as unknown' add a gear icon with all options. Or a Red/yellow/green type button where one is selected.

Public/Private Word Lists and sub lists
	Something that would work for yoyo 300
	Be able to browse all the hsk and most common words, or search, and easily add them to lists (that can be used as flashcards.)
	This will probably be the base for flash cards.

Definition partial with links to tags (and extra tags at the end)
	tags page with all content for that tag

Add a button at bottom to show chinese text and pinyin.

Show articles tags/categories in title
	Allow sharing other stuff as well
Add links to share on social media
Add image to articles
Add image to sources (and a whole page with a review)

Add bookmark to save your spot for longer articles.

GAMES! Challenges, quizes...
	numbers, how fast can you type them in, etc..

Add ratings to articles

Things can be flaggable for different reasons
Add a way to request content takedowns.

Ajax Comments

Word lists (stats on lists, tests, find material etc.)

Sentence page - People can comment and colaborate on the translations. 

Add a way to add arbitrary tags to a definition? 

Finish Tokenizing (Do some of this not necesarily all for alpha)
	Look ahead to all three words
	Order by how many tokens are associated with that word. (if any).
		It will start out sucking but it will get better over time.

	use tags to help order words (in addition to site usage, which should trump these.)
		Surname (lower priority)
		variant of <word>(as only definition lowers priority)
		see <word> (as only definition lowers priority)
		Tag anything with an upper case (lowers priority, higher priority then surname)
		Lower priority for (archaic) tag

Tokenizing is pretty cool, have something users can tokenize (comments?)
Improve Tokenizing
	Look at possible three words, take word of longest
	Take word from set of three with least deviation
	Take most commonly used word from site
		Take into consideration previous word? For example use a measure word after a number?

Categorization
	Articles should have tags and categories.
	More difficult articles should start having chinese titles (would have to be processed though)
		Article has a title which has a sentence which has tokens that link to words.
	Add a header (english or chinese) to preface the material

Settings (need balance here, can't make it too complicated. Simplicity!)
	Characters size
	Show Pinyin.
	Show Sentence Translations. (easy mode)
	Show top definition for unknown words?
		Maybe show definition if the definition was set and the word in not learning/known
	Character size.
	Text size.
	Settings for where to show translations,
	Auto-show, mouse-over, or hide.
	Simlifited vs Traditional
	Word Spacing/seperators

Word Page:
	For each word, find the words that it is a substring of, and link them.
	Link a word to all its classifiers
	Link a word to it’s components.
	Link <abbr. to> and <abbr. of>/<abbr. for>

Parse Tags
	Parse out “also pr. [pronunciation]” and flag as alternate pronunciation.
	Parse out “also written (simp)|(traditional) [pronunciation] - some value  optional it looks like.
	Remove “lit.” and “fig.” and flag the definition with a type.
	Special parsing for (idiom), these can have a literal meaning plus plus idiom meaning.
	Other tags to parse out potentially:
		(derog.)
		(proverb)
		CL:(simp)|(trad)[pronunciation]
		Taiwan pr.
		surname <name>
		(name)
		(expr.)
		abbr. for 

Replace sth with subject, etc...

--------------------------
Release - Refine (still take it easy on adding new features and move features down to get a release out!)
--------------------------
Conversations
	Invite only
	You can write messages and tokenize them.
	It will look very different for me vs a native chinese speaker.

Allow turning the UI to chinese (need chinese for each option.)
	This could be done over time if you mark one button at a time as known and it shows up in chinese individually.

Easy Mode:
	Allow specifying a specific definition for the easiest content, and show the (here: ) definition under the pinyin for unknown words.
	This is a lot of extra work so it would only be for the easiest content.

Content Discovery
	Discover content based on characters know
	Show progress towards hsk char/word levels
	Recomend new words to learn based on known characters (you should learn a word that is composed of known characters)
	Recomend the next characters that are the most commonly known.
	Be able to view any sentence from an article and save them.

Graphs
	Top known characters by users.
	Site character frequency. (vs global)

Comments should be tokenizable.

Tools
	The site will have some decent tools available. (splitting words, simplified/traditional/pinyin/pronunciation conversions, translations)
	Search by english, simplified, traditional, pinyin
	Build a controller to expose those to the world.

Awards
	Learned 1 (or n) characters
	Added 1 (or n) translations
	Vote on 1 (or n) translations
	A Chinese scholar knows 20000 characters
	-----
	6000 educated chinese
	1000 characters will make you literate
	200 characters to read menus, basic web pages and newspaper headlines
	-----
	While there are well over 50,000 Chinese characters, you don't need to know them all!
	Knowing just 1,000 Chinese characters will enable you to understand approximately 90% of written Chinese.
	Knowing 2,500 characters will enable you to understand approximately 98% of written Chinese.
	And knowing all the 4,000 characters in our database will enable you to understand virtually 100%.
	To be considered literate, you only need to recognize around 3000 characters.

	-----
	Beginner
		can recognize about 500 Chinese characters
		have very limited vocabulary based on those characters
		understand very basic sentence structure
	Elementary
		can recognize 500 to 1500 Chinese characters

		have grasped a good amount of vocabulary to understand articles and conversations with more in-depth
		capable of understanding various sentence patterns, compound words and long sentences
		can randomly read through a general topic article with good comprehension without look-up

Movies/Audio/Music! with subtitles/transcript/pinyin/translations/definitions
	This will take more work, but there is lots of materials out there to source from
	This will need to have some automation, but can start being more manual
	Example: A music video where the subtitles (taking into consideration the learned words) plays along the bottom.

Tips
	Allow users to associate things with words for tips (images, words, hints)

Pnumonics

Tone-Pairs

Spaced Repetition/Flashcards.

Challenges!
	Build a simple test.
	Challenge people to pass it.
	Give them a period of time to prepare then give it to them.
	They get awards for passing challenges of different difficulties.

Pop Quiz (all can be multiple choice)
	Type the pinyin/pronuciation
	Type the english
	Match word to image
	Pick the character/pinyin for a word or image.
	Sounds... 

Annotate Comments and Custom Texts
	Premium? This could be useful to read comments that are posted in chinese.
		Might want to keep seperate join tables for this to seperate it from articles.
	Let people upload their own text and use the reader with their known characters.
	These would have to go through some other step before being public (peer reviews or admin acceptance)

Join table from user to word with notes/pictures/mnumonics/etc..
	Pos

Blog

	Memory techniques - Get Emotional

	About
		This site is for beginners to reading (not beginners to chinese). The goal is for people with limited bag of characters to have something to read.
		Hiding pinyin in the mousover makes it too hard to read. (Especially f you have a vocab bigger then your character set.)
		Customizable characters size (recomend you start big and reduce the size as you get to larger texts.)
		All the information is in a single place. Mouseover is reserved for additonal information and word controls)

	Inspiration
		Yoyochinese character course (from beta)
		Chinesereadingpractice.com
		There is some more. not necissarily inspiration though...

	Usage
		Should know some chinese and be familiar with pinyin/characters.
		Not necissarily for learning characters (could be a future features.)
		Find content that you can read, and read stuff.

	Philosophy
		Lots of chinese sites with intermediate to advanced reading material. This site is to get you from beginner to intermediate.

		Most sites have so much content, i'l encourage using as many sites as possible, this site tries to only implement features that it does well.
			Ask people to let me know if i'm not doing something well and i'll re-evaluate the feature.

		I find learning characters a tedious task.
		I want to me able to read in chinese!
		A wall of chinese text is too intimidating, I need something with pinyin.
			What characters do I know vs just recognize? Gets crazy.
			If you marked yourself as knowing 40 characters, then you can focus on reenforcing those characters and slowly learning new ones.

		Need to be able to phase out the pinyin.
		Learning characters is usefull, but i prefer to learn chinese words!
		Diversify! Use this along with other methods. (any way to integrate with other methods?) (download card packs?)
		Write too! Will this be implemented into the site?
		Speak first then read, and also write for practice...
		Use spacial/visual memories (memory palace.) Crazy, raunchy, stinky, wierd, excentric the better.
		You don't have to try to read every character. just skim/read the english translations and focus on the your characters you are learning. (requires easy mode.)
