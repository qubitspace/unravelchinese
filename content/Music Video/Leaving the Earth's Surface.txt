丢掉手表 丢外套 丢掉背包 再丢唠叨
Throw away your watch, throw off your coat, throw away your backpack, and throw off your chatter
丢掉电视　丢电脑　丢掉大脑　再丢烦恼
Throw away your television, throw out your computer, throw away your big brain, and throw out your troubles

冲啥大　冲啥小　冲啥都有人唱反调
Do something big, do something small, no matter what you do there will always be someone opposing you
恨的多　爱的少　只想越跳越疯　越跳越高　把地球甩掉
Hate so much, love so little, just want to jump crazier and crazier, jump higher and higher, abandon the earth

一颗心噗通噗通的狂跳
A heart, thumping, thumping, crazily jumping
一瞬间烦恼烦恼烦恼全忘掉
At the same time, troubles, troubles, troubles completely forgotten
我再也不要　再也不要　委屈自己一秒
I don't want, don't want to demean myself another second

一颗心噗通噗通的狂跳
A heart, thumping, thumping, crazily jumping
一瞬间烦恼烦恼烦恼全忘掉
At the same time, troubles, troubles, troubles completely forgotten
我甩掉地球　地球甩掉　只要越跳越高
I'll abandon the earth, the earth abandoned, just want to jump higher and higher

丢掉手表　丢外套　丢掉背包　再丢唠叨
Throw away your watch, throw off your coat, throw away your backpack, and throw off your chatter
丢掉电视　丢电脑　丢掉大脑　再丢烦恼
Throw away your television, throw out your computer throw away your big brain, and throw off your troubles
野心大　胆子小　跳舞还要靠别人教
Grand ambitions, slight courage, to dance I'll need someone to teach me
恨得多　爱的少　只想　越跳越疯　越跳越高　把地球甩
Hate so much, love so little, just want to jump crazier and crazier, jump higher and higher abandon the earth

一颗心噗通噗通的狂跳
A heart, thumping, thumping, crazily jumping
一瞬间烦恼烦恼烦恼全忘掉
At the same time, troubles, troubles, troubles completely forgotten
我再也不要　再也不要　委屈自己一秒
I don't want, don't want to demean myself another second

一颗心噗通噗通的狂跳
A heart, thumping, thumping, crazily jumping
一瞬间烦恼烦恼烦恼全忘掉
At the same time, troubles, troubles, troubles completely forgotten

I'll abandon the earth, the earth abandoned, just want to jump higher and higher
