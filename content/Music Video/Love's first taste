如果说你要离开我
If you are going to leave me
请诚实点来告诉我
Please be honest come and tell me
不要偷偷摸摸的走
Don't go with out telling me
像上次一样等半年
Like last time I waited for half a year
如果说你真的要走
If you are really going
把我的照片还给我
Give me my photos back
在你身上也没有用
You don't need them anymore
我可以还给我妈妈
I can give them back to my mom
什么天长地久
What everlasting
只是随便说说
It was just a joke
你爱我那一点
Why do you love me
你也说不出口
You can't tell either
你认识了帅哥
You met a handsome guy
就把我丢一旁
So you dumped me
天气热的夏​​天
Summer is hot
心像寒冷冬夜
But my heart is cold like winter night
想要买酒来浇忧愁
Want to buy some beers to abreact
却懒懒不想出去走
But too lazy can't be bothered
想要来一包长寿烟
Want to buy a pack of Long Life cigarettes
发现我未满十八岁
Found out I'm not eighteen yet

发现我未满十八岁
Found out I'm not eighteen yet
是不是我的十八岁
I was not eighteen years old
注定要为爱情流泪
Destined to cry for love
