很晚了。
It was late.
他一个人坐着。
He was sitting alone.
桌上是空酒瓶子。
There was empty wine bottles on the table.
他和她分手有十个小时了。
Ten hours had passed since the two of them broke up.
他只觉得夜很长也很凉。
He felt the night was too long, and too cold.

而她正坐在火车上想着他们分手的下午。
She was riding on a train thinking about the afternoon that they broke up.
不记得他们为什么争吵。
She couldn’t even remember why there were fighting.
可是他们都喊出了分手两个字。
However both of them used the word 'breakup'.
就这样他们以分手结束了三年的爱情。
Just like that, they broke up and ended their three year relationship.

可是她还爱着他。
However, she was still in love with him.
她想恨他。
She wanted to hate him.
可越这样想就越想哭。
Yet the more she tried the more she wanted to cry.
她用手挡住脸不让火车上的人看见她哭。
She covered her face with here hands so that people on the train wouldn't see her cry.

这时手机响了。
Her cell phone rang.
那是他的号码。
It was his number.
她拿起手机没有说话。
She answered the phone but didn’t say anything.

“莘恨我吗?”他问她。
“Xin, do you hate me?” he asked her.

她想说是的可她忍住了。
She wanted to say yes but held it back.

“恨我吧。
“Hate me.
只要你还能想着我。
As long as you think about me.
恨我我也幸福。”
Even if you hate me I'm still happy.”

她的眼睛又湿了。
Her eyes got wet again.

“莘告诉我你说分手是认真的还是气话？”
“Xin, tell me, when you said ‘break up’ were you serious or was it just angry words?”

她想说是气话可她回答“我是认真的你不也是吗？”
She wanted to say it was just angry words but she answered “I was serious, weren’t you？”

“我？”男人顿了一下。
“Me?” the man paused for a little while.
“我说分手是因为习惯。
“I said ‘break up’ due to a habit.
你知道的。”
You know that.”

“习惯?!”女人很生气。
“Habit?!” The woman was getting very angry.

“不是吗？
“Isn’t it?
莘每次你说要看电影我就说好看电影。
Xin, every time you say let’s go watch a movie I agree to see a movie.
你说要吃川菜我就说好吃川菜。
You say let’s eat Szechuan food and I agree to go eat Szechuan.
今天下午你说分手我就很傻的重复了一句好分手。
This afternoon you said 'break up!' and I was stupid enough to repeat 'let’s break up.'
说完我就明白我完了。”
The moment I said it I knew I was totally screwed.”

莘忍不住在电话里笑出了声。
Xin couldn’t help laughing in the phone.
这会儿女人开口了“傻瓜又喝酒了？”
This time it was her turn to ask, "silly, have you been drinking?”

“嗯分手的酒不好喝很苦。”
“Eh, this breakup wine tastes aweful.”

“那等我开会回来陪你喝。
“Then wait for me to drink with you after my meeting.
我明天就回来了。”
I’ll be back tomorrow.”

“我会在站台上等你。
“I’ll be waiting for you on the platform.
莘我爱你。”
Xin, I love you.”

“我们再也不分手了好吗？”
“We will not break up again, OK?”

“听你的我们再也不分手。”
“Agree, we won’t break up again.”

夜开始变暖。
The night was getting warmer.
